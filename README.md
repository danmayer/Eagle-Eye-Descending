Eagle-Eye-Descending
====================

This is a restoration of a book my grandfather wrote. Using OCR, cleanup, and some effort I plan to convert it to a ebook.

I have become interested in digital preservation of books, photos, etc a bit. The most interesting to me has been the written word and ebooks. I started to learn more about ebooks building several tools for myself to manage my kindle. First just plugging it in and using file syncing from my own files to the device. Then I built out a service [blog2ebook](http://blog2ebook.picoappz.com/) that would convert a blog into a ebook. I also use it to send files or snippets to my kindle to read later. This interest lead me to become curious about the publishing process of ebooks. I didn't really have anything worth publishing myself, but remembered my grandfather's book which he was never able to get published. Given the magic and ease of self publishing in today's digital world, I decided I would try to publish his old book myself.

Unfortunately I found that I could not dig up a digital copy and could only find one hard copy remaining. I looked into various OCR services, software, and solutions. I ended up OCRing the document myself and since that is not very accurate especially on old document piecing the missing parts back together.

While converting the book to the ebook format, I will try to keep all the formatting and text as close as possible to the original.

technology used:

* Samsung S3 phone
* Google Docs android app 'scan' function
* Google docs online app for converting, fixing, and minor editing of the OCR text
* HTML5 for book formatting
* [blog2book](http://blog2ebook.picoappz.com/) to convert the html document to a Kindle book

<a name='chap1' /><h3>Prologue</h3>
<br/>

<p>By 1982 the "Cold War" between two former World War II allies, had 
dominated world affairs for some 37 years. It involved millions of people on 
each side and millions more around the World, trying to guess which way to 
jump. The main protagonists, at the individual human level, were in many 
ways markedly similar yet en mass ideologically incompatible. The conflict and 
its various worldwide ramifications had tainted virtually all aspects of life in 
both America and the U.S.S.R. over that period. indirectly it further impacted, 
to varying degrees, just about all other people on the planet.
</p><p>
More ominous however, the advanced weaponry developed by both sides had 
escalated potential combat from the massive tank battles, air raids, and sea 
engagements projected by WW lI experience to a Nuclear Armageddon. 
M.A.D., a benign technical abbreviation for the appalling reality of Mutually 
Assured Destruction. Now relative to its impact on humanity, a brief ICBM 
</p><p>
exchange might well rival the earlier meteoric collision credited with rendering 
the Dinosaurs and many other of Earth’s life forms extinct! 
</p><p>
In concert with the development of weaponry, Orbital Surveillance systems had 
however, also progressed to amazing levels of capability. In effect, after some 
initial alarms, before both sides had achieved some level of equivalency, the 
resulting intelligence actually served to mitigate dangerous tension on both 
sides. Particularly those based on uncertainties regarding what the other guy 
had and what he was planning to do with it. Still the natural legacy of paranoia 
and distrust, engendered by the long ideological conflict, rendered the vagaries 
of day to day operations of such systems fraught with danger. Even the 
potential, enhanced by fear, for triggering a mindless nuclear exchange.
</p><p>
In the stark, cold vacuum of space the orbiting "Eagle Eye" system had been 
steadfastly tracking along its North/South polar orbital flight path for the past 
33 days. No sound accompanied its swift progress, despite the continual 
functioning of varied mechanical and electrical systems within. Its' silence, 
unrelated to the fanciful absence of a validating human ear, but simply for lack 
the atmospheric medium to transmit sound.</p>

<p>Employed in conjunction with the manned U-2 overflight and loitering 
capability the resulting reconnaissance network possessed capabilities beyond 
anything previously imagined. With the “Corona” ability to observe and 
photograph any point of interest on Earth every four days,  recovered 
material could be examined for anything suspicious or threatening and if of 
significant concern, a U-2 mission put up to take a closer more detailed look. 
</p><p>
One of the earliest, most significant pay backs of the operation was an easing of 
tension at the highest level of U. S. defense circles, resulting from graphic 
photographic evidence that the Russians were significantly behind U.S. missile 
development and possessed far fewer operational I.C.B.M.’S on the pad than 
some of the more pessimistic assessments had projected. 
</p><p>
While still an extremely dangerous stand off with little trust on either side, the 
passage of time and passing of a few of the old revolutionary "Bolsheviks" had 
further seemed to moderate the level of paranoia and hysteria that 
characterized earlier Russian leadership, fostering at least a more rational 
antagonism. In concert however with this change for the better every where 
else in the world, conditions grew worse. The ultimate demise of colonialism, 
revolutionary emergence of new political factions, industrialization and 
modernization of a number of here to fore "backward" societies, with still 
others reverting to tribal behavior, all precipitated the rise of new coniiicts. In 
many of these, the opposing factions often supported by the U.S. or U.S.S.R., in 
proxy wars, still attempting to mold the world in their disparate images. The 
result in the Near East, Far East, South America, Africa and even nearby Cuba, 
the emergence of a larger, more complex network of threats to America. 
Collectively they made the simple one on one antagonism of the early cold war 
seem almost attractive by comparison.
</p><p>
Fortuitously the continued growth in capabilities of U. S. surveillance systems, through continuous improvement of their original elements and operational procedures, plus the sequential addition of new sophisticated sensing devices, provided the necessary enhanced capability to meet the demand for increased  
world wide surveillance. With regularly updated inputs, they could pretty well 
quantify everyone’s assets, friend or foe's and when or where they might be 
massed or moved. Unfortunately, no sensor has yet been devised to determine
"Intent". A fact which continued to keep the game interesting and necessary.
</p><p>
Now, for this particular mission, the payload canister in the lirst of two 
"Retriever" reentry vehicles on board had filled to capacity with superb
<!-- page 5 -->
qualify, high-resolution photography and other sophisticated intelligence data. 
Leaving, Only, the final most dramatic and crucial  0f the Operation That 
of returning the collected data to Earth for examination and interpretation 
Though Proven and refined over several hundred similar operations, the 
associated Sequence of de-orbìt, reentry and recovery of the Payload Capsule
(familiarly referred to as "The Bucket") still constituted the ultimate "Home Stretch"
rush of excitement.
</p><p>
The technology facilitating that specific rush, evolved from one of the
earliest technical challenges faced by the fledgling Space technologists in the new 
industry. Natures master plan for Protecting Earth from catastrophic collisions was
orbiting space debris, employs the high Velocity of such bodies as they 
plunge into our upper atmosphere. The enormous frictional heat thus generated 
is Sufficient to vaporize all but the largest bodies which fortunately, are 
extremely rare. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, ICBM re-entry bodies and Orbital return vehicles all replicate 
the behavior of such bodies when they plow into the atmosphere on their return
to earth. Science obviously had to thrawt Mother Nature, if these vehicles were to
survive the initial phase of reentry and get on with their ultimate purpose.
To pull this off, techniques to precisely control reentry and ablative heat shield 
materials were developed. These materials have the unique quality of flashing dirctly
from a solid to a gas (Ablation) when exposed to high heating rates and in the process
absorb large amounts of that heat at their surface while acting as an insulator for anything
below the surface. Thus, perhaps to the consternation of the Creator, his creatures have
managed to subvert his perfectly workable system, which has thus far, protected
their home planet from becoming a pummeled ruin, to achieve their own questionable ends. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
So now, after standing by almost passively throughout the various early stages 
of the operation, the "Retriever" Return Vehicle would finally earn its orbital
ride by doing its wild, fiery thing. The terminal step of bringing home to Earth,
its' bard won intelligence payload for the mystical machinations and 
prestidigitation by the "Spooks" at the N.R.O.!

God! She was beautiful. After 30 years together and the four kids, he still loved 
to look at her. Fascinated by all her moods and postures he would often watch 
her in pure enjoyment, seemingly, without her awareness of his attention. Now, 
in perhaps her most feminine mode, Jan stood before her mirror dressed to 
party, adding final artistic touches to her hair and makeup. Even with a 
sufficient smattering of green to satisfy the St. Paddy's day motif, the sleek, 
fitted skirt and spike heels presented a stately elegance characteristic of Jan 
herself, but hardly the earthy concept of a traditional Colleen. He couldn't help 
but smile at the memory of last years costume party with Jan the hit as a 
somewhat exotic lrish barmaid, and himself as an unlikely oversized 
Leprechaun.
</p><p>
With a mixture of awe and pride, he often wondered how she managed t0 pull it 
off efficiently managing their iarge exuberant brood, while maintaining her role 
of wife, lover, party butterfly, and social activist. All this with a surprising 
tolerance for his somewhat esoteric profession and its' many impositions on 
their family life.
</p><p>
They had first met in one of those chance encounters that, at the time, seem such 
a normal part of the young social scene and then turn out to be pivotal events of 
a life time. After three years in World War Il as a U.S. Army Air Corps
mechanic, somewhat frustrated because a High School Football eye injury had 
thwarted his desire to fly, he was in his junior year at Duquesne University    
School of Engineering. For him a dream come true by virtue of the U.S.
Government and the G.I. Bill. With a working widowed mother and a younger brother 
to worry about, since early High School, he had anticipated and was   
prepared to undertake the drudgery of holding a daytime job for years, while
pursuing an Engineering Degree at night school. Then close on the joyful 
realization of having returned from the Pacific War in one piece, a "Grateful 
Nation" was prepared to provide the where with all for him to attend college 
full time, in a normal four year format. His cup damn near "Runneth Over"! 
To him it was a "Paid in Full" from that grateful nation for the three years he 
had given in their service.

<p>
Now absence became more frequent and longer,  perhaps most disturbing 
the fact that he was unable even to tell Jan where he was going, or at times, 
when he would return. "If anything comes up, call Kells and she'll get the 
message to me."
</p><p>
The highly efficient "Kells", Ms Evelyn Kelly, his harried, high security 
secretary, was constantly on the brink of a well deserved nervous breakdown. 
ln addition to her more prosaic secretarial duties, she also served as the singular 
communication link between some forty other traveling "Spooks" under his 
command and their bewildered loved ones. 
</p><p>
The "Retriever" program was classified as a "Special need to know" operation, 
well beyond "Top Secret" and its related security measures were commensurate 
with that lofty level of conspiratorial paranoia. The effects of such rigorous 
requirements for secrecy, on the personnel thus engaged, were many and varied, 
some humorous and some stultifying. 
</p><p>
The rigid monthly accounting for all classified documents, invariably led to, at 
least, one hysterical secretary in tears, in the ladies room over the temporary 
misplacemcnt of a report, drawing or specification. On these occasions, the 
indomitable "Kells", drawing on her personal experience, as big sister to a large 
Irish family, enlarged her span of control to that of house mother to such 
distraught young women, who envisioned themselves on the way to Levenworth. 
On others, particularly some engineers involved in the intricacies of design and 
operations, the effect of such overbearing secrecy was to adopta permanent 
sotto voce, conspiratorial tone, that annoyingly, persisted for all occasions. 
Particularly irritating, when employed in response to irrelevant questions about 
the weather or how they liked their coffee.
</p><p>
Aptly named, "Retriever" was simply a complete ReentrylRecovery Vehicle 
system, initially employed with, "Corona" and subsequently, a number of other 
orbital reconnaissance systems, such as "Eagle Eye". lt was designed, to 
precisely and reliably return from orbit, the photographic film and associated 
data, generated by the sophisticated cameras and other sensors in these 
operational surveillance satellites. 
</p><p>
One of Americas' most outstanding successes among early attempts to employ 
space technology for military purposes. Surely far preferable to the more 
widely recognized potential for delivery of nuclear warheads. The System had 
performed reliably and with increasing capability since its' early development

<!-- page 9 -->
under the original "Corona" program. The collective output of these systems, 
in effect, drove the Russians "Bonkers" and kept an unblinking eye on other hot 
spots such as Cuba, China, Iran, Iraq, plus lesser sites of periodic minor wars 
and revolutions that might ultimately precipitate American involvement. 
</p><p>
Without being able to share the satisfaction and excitement of direct _ 
Involvement in such anendeavor, Jan seemed to sense the passion of his 
participation and from it, draw a measure of fortitude, sufficient to tolerate
the associated inconveniences.
</p><p>
Tonight however, she was ready for an evening out with old friends in a party atmosphere.
Sartorially armed and dangerous, ready to do battle with her lady friends for the honors as
Top Babe in the neighborhood. Looking at her now, she sure could count on his vote! 
</p><p>
First, Jan's customary final instructions to Elle and Lainie, their two remaining 
High Schoolers at home. "No unannounced visitors, finish your homework, limited television,
and to bed at a reasonable hour." The girl's cound have  recited them from rote and
hardly looked up from their homework to acknowledge. Then, as an afterthought, writing
the Blaines' telephone number on the kitchen note pad, which, while readily accessible
in the phone book, served to emphasize their close proximity, if anything came up 
requiring parental attention.
</p><p>
Now, in the ear for the three blocks drive to the Blaines, Jan chatted on about 
her growing desire to return to the work force. With both younger girls now in 
High School and the older two boys in college, there was no longer a pressing 
need for someone at home. Consequently, Jan was starting to heed the call of a 
of a more dynamic daily environment. Rog had some very mixed feelings about such
a change in their family routine. True, the added income would cut down 
 on the accruing debt associated with putting four kids through college but there 
is no such thing as "Free Lunch" and he knew it. This however was an evening 
for fun and relaxation, not controversy, so he strategically withheld serious 
comment, knowing full well that it would come up again, and soon. 
</p><p>
A number of early arrivals, required their parking down the block from the 
Blaines. The night however, was crisp and clear and the short walk provided a 
refreshing interval, as a prelude to the crowded boisterous party atmosphere in 
prospect.

<p>
Throughout the developmental process, from the initial "Corona" concept to
the present, multi-sensored intelligence gathering satellites, associated triumphs 
and tragedies abounded, some even, with their humorous side. 
</p><p>
The unfortunate reentry overshoot of an early developmental model and its 
subsequent landing near a Russian, mining camp in the Arctic, was not one of 
the funny ones. It led to their early acquisition of a technically priceless 
American ilight unit, which, no doubt, greatly accelerated their lagging 
developments in this area. The event, iictionally depicted, to some degree, in 
Ian Flemings "Ice Station Zebra", presented a stupefying example of art 
mimicking life beyond all rational explanation. 
</p><p>
Initially, after a brief period of productive covert observation, the Russians 
tumbled to the realization, that their key facilities and activities were being 
photographed from space on a regular basis. Coincident with that 
understanding, insulting messages such as "F--k you, Yank!" began to appear 
on hanger roofs and other surfaces at their various military installations. They 
also'initiated a number of creative attempts at camouflage and deception to 
mask their points and activities of interest. 
</p><p>
Later, when they developed the capability for orbital photo reconnaissance, our 
side enthusiastically joined them in the game of roof top harassment. In the ¿t 
midst of the grim give and take of cold warfare, it almost provided a humorous “di 
camaraderie between the initiated and an outlet for acid wit on both side.
</p><p>
A later American "Gotcha" added renewed spice to the game, with introduction
of an advanced model, which featured considerably longer orbital life and greater capacity.
This expanded capability required multiple "Retriever"
reentry/recovery vehicles, returned sequentially, as each reached its full payload capacity.
Examination of the photography in the second recovered -ï vehicle of the first revised orbital operation, nearly knocked the sox off the N.R.O. photo interpreter spooks. Scores of new items of interest were

The neighborhood early birds were already there and remaining Iaggards 
arriving rapidly, mostly couples, with the occasional single survivor of family 
tragedy, natural or legal. An interesting mix, ethnic, religious or political 
persuasion, but from the celtic viewpoint, on St. Patrick’s day, all present, either 
Irish, or "Thim that wish they wuz!" 
</p><p>
Annie and Josh Blaine, aggressively the former, welcomed them when they 
arrived, directing them to the bar in the game room and the upstairs bedroom 
for dropping off their coats. A simple but unnecessary opening formality, 3S 
they could easily find both blindfolded, after years on the local party circuit, of 
which the Blaines were an integral part. 
</p><p>
Returning to the bar area, from his dropping off the coats chore, Rog found Jan 
in conversation with Liz and Harry Duffey and the Barthalemews, Millie and 
Bob. Both neighbors and friends of long standing with much in common, 
including kids away at college. The trials and tribulations of those displaced 
offspring was the subject of the current conversation, as it invariably was 
whenever they got together. After a few drinks, the conversation would turn to 
more diverse, less mundane subjects. 
</p><p>
Both Harry and Bob were blessed with excellent voices and a bit of amateur 
theatrical work in their college days. Later, after a few drinks, in keeping with 
Irish partying tradition, they would end up competently harmonizing on 
"Danny Boy“, "Galloway Bay" and other favorites, while the rest of the drunks, 
including Rog, would, inadvertently, do their best to louse up the beauty of the 
thing, by joining in. 
</p><p>
He spotted Abe Klein and Sylvie just coming down the steps and eased over to 
say hello. He had wanted to talk to Abe privately anyway and this was as good a 
time as any. Abe, like himself, had worked at Omega Technologies for a 
number of years. In fact in their younger days they had worked several projects 
together and had become friends. For several years now Abe had headed up the 
Thermodynamics Analysis Group and Rog considered Dick Flowers, assigned to 
him on Project "Retriever" from that group, one of his key players. Rumors

and having grown up playing stick ball and other local favorites with his 
contemporaries ofthe streets, Rubin Belkoff was perhaps even better liked than 
his father and easily took his place in the community. The crowning indicator 
of his place in local Gallic hearts, came when he was invited to be an honorary 
member on the Hibernian Society and march with them in the local St. Patrick’s 
day parade. This he did with great glee and as they pranced by the family 
pharmacy, Sylvie, her .Grand mother, her mother and two siblings, stood at the 
curb and waved small green St. Patrick’s day flags, enjoying the event 
immensely. 
</p><p>
Abe and Silvie's three children, agewise, were distributed such that they were 
involved with the Mannion brood throughout their growing processes in a 
broad spectrum of school and recreational activities. Hank and Julie, both 
families eldest, enjoyed a quasi- romantic friendship through out high school. 
They attended some dances and other parties together and then were formal 
dates at their Junior Prom. In their senior year however, preoccupied with 
coming college and career planning, any earlier ardor appeared to 
metamorphosis into a solid friendship which has persisted in spite oftheir 
divergent career interests. Now, Julie was a senior Physics major at Columbia, 
already accepted for graduate work at M.I.T. with long term plans for a 
doctorate and a research career. She was also romantically involved with a 
Colombia graduate student in chemistry and seemed happily destined to join 
him ultimately in solving the worlds energy shortage. 
</p><p>
Hank, had developed an increasing passion, throughout his lligh School years,
for Scuba diving. He and YRog had taken an introductory course at the local 
YMCA which culminated in certification and authorization to rent diving 
equipment and use it. Initially, they enjoyed diving together at several nearby 
lakes and quarries but where Rog was content to keep it simple and 
recreational, Hank joined an active diving group. He soon had acquired his own
gear and was into serious ocean diving at various wrecks and other points of 
diving interest, while still in High School. As a natural consequence he was now 
finishing work on his Bachelors Degree in Marine Biology at University of 
Florida and had been accepted for Graduate work in Oceanography' at Woods 
Hole. Romantically, he had yet to develop any serious attachments, but 
appeared to be enjoying all those beautiful girls in bathing suits he encountered 
in the normal pursuit of his academics.

<p>Specific de-orbît instructions for "Retriever" had been uploaded to "mother" in 
lts last orbital pass over station "Bourbon" in the Australian outback. Now the 
system was approaching the sequence initiation point and things were starting 
to happen. 
</p><p>
The first action in the process of separating the reentry vehicle from "Mother", 
required disconnecting the umbilical cord providing electrical contact between 
"Retriever" and the rest ofthe "Eagle Eye" system during orbital operations. 
Not unlike unplugging the family vacuum cord from a wall socket at home, the 
plug however, considerably larger, more complex and the force to unplug it, 
provided by a small controlled explosive charge. 
</p><p>
Now with precise timing to set off that charge, the onboard programmer 
directed a small spike of electric current to the igniter squib in the umbilical 
disconnect unit. The resulting small blast, would literally blow apart the two 
mated segments constituting the connector. It was the simplest of functions in a 
sequence including some very complex ones, flawlessly repeated several 
hundred times in past operations, only this time, as if to demonstrate that there 
is no permanent reprieve from “Murphy’s Law”, nothing happened! No blast! 
No movement! No disconnect! The damned thing failed to lire! Leaving 
Retriever inexorably tied to “Mother” by an Electrical cable pull tested to 
withstand well over 1000 pounds. 
</p><p>
Over many years of operations, this particular anomaly had never occurred and 
because the event was so uncomplicated and unanticipated, there was no sensing 
provided in the system to detect it. Thus, unaware that “Murphy” had struck at 
this most unlikely point, the sequence continued uninterrupted. 
</p><p>
As programmed, two seconds later, simultaneous, small electrical pulses were 
transmitted to the three explosive attachment bolts retaining the "Retriever" 
vehicle in its mounting cradle. All fired, as planned, releasing the vehicle and 
allowing the spring ejection system to propel it away from its mounting surface, 
for subsequent spin up at a safe distance from "Mother".

<p>After three hours of small talk, neighborhood gossip, and a plethora ofjoke 
swapping, the Blaines party was proceeding nicely. With an obvious preference 
for jokes relative to the "Ould Sod" and its flamboyant inhabitants, it was 
fascinating to listen to versions of an Irish brogue, by people of various other 
ethnic backgrounds. Surprisingly, Abe Klein was more adept at it, than most of 
those born to the tongue, and his repertoire of humor of all kinds was legend.~ 
</p><p>
Between varied discussions with her cadre of neighborhood girl friends, Jan had 
been cruising the gathering, lightly flirtatious, touching base with her numerous 
male admirers and fending off light hearted passes, which long ago, she had 
made clear were fun and flattering but futile. It was her version 0f a reality 
check t0 reaffirm that she still had it. Privately, she and Rog kidded about it 
regularly and had many a laugh over some of the ramifications of her harmless 
party pastime. 
</p><p>
Predictably, Harry and Bob had drifted to a corner of the downstairs game 
room and surrounded by a group, mostly the men, in varying degrees of 
inebriation, were running through their respectable repertoire of lrish songs. 
Even with the less than complimentary accompaniment of some of the drunks, 
the total group sounded pretty good. Rog could stay with them without doing 
too much artistic damage until they had to hit the higher end of the scale. Then, 
in frustration, lamented the vagaries of genetics, which, in spite ofa 
predominant Irish heritage had cursed him with a limited vocal range. At times 
like this, "Danny Boy" brought tears to his eyes, part from sentiment and part 
in frustration. Perhaps accelerated by accompanying Bushmills and soda. 
Normally a Scotch drinker, he always made a point to switch to Irish whiskey 
on St. Patrick’s day. 
</p><p>
They were just finishing a raucous version of "Who threw the overalls in Mrs.
Murphy"s Chowder", when Marge Blaine called him from the top of the steps 
to say he had a telephone call. As with most parents with kids at home, his focus
leapt immediately to what might have transpired there. Then, Marge, a fellow

the courage to submit a Technical paper for presentation at an American 
Institute ofAeronautics and Astronautics Symposium. The subject, a 
hypothetical design concept of an Orbital Recovery Vehicle for commercial 
applications, drawing 0n what “Retriever” experience he was able to disclose 
without violating security restrictions. Somewhat to his surprise, the paper was 
accepted and he was invited to present it at the annual A.I.A.A. symposium in 
San Diego. Despite a bit of nervous tension relative to the actual presentation , 
it was well received and quite Satisfying personally, once it was over. Now, two

<!-- page 24 -->

<p>
years later with courage born of experience, he had submitted a second paper,
this time presenting a manned orbital escape concept, a “Space Life boat,” 
again drawing on proven “Retriever” technology. Again, he was please to get 
acceptance and an invitation to present at this years symposium in Boston. 
Unfortunately, the symposium date was one and a half weeks hence! 
</p><p>
Parking in his reserved slot in the secure lot along side the main building, 
briefcase in hand, he locked the ear and headed for the well lighted front lobby. 
There Harry, one of the more senior security guards on duty, carefully checked 
his badge even though they had known each other for years. "l guess all you 
Spooks enjoy working at night, Mr. Mannion, Mr. Ehling passed through about 
fifteen minutes ago, then Mr. Ullinger just before you. Now, there's Mr. 
Newell's car just pulling into the lot." As an old hand, cleared at a relatively ' 
high security level, Harry knew it best to treat these bazaar comings and goings, 
not uncommon in the trade, with humor rather than any unwelcome curiosity. 
</p><p>
Rog waited for Crey Newell as he walked in from the lot and passed through 
security. Then together they took the elevator to their fifth floor, high security, 
cipher locked area. Crey, one of those strikingly handsome men, had 
actually done some male modeling to pay his way through Engineering School 
and then, later, his graduate studies. Many of his more casual associates and 
most of the secretaries he encountered, wondered why, with his looks, he hadn't 
continued on into full time modeling or tried some form of show business? 
They, simply didn't know the guy. If there ever was an individual who loved 
technology and engineering it was Crey. He had the fascination of all scientists, 
to know how things work with the added compulsion common to engineers, to 
translate that knowledge into useful devices and systems. He had the bug, had it 
in spades, and would never have been happy doing anything else. His specialty 
was Structural Analysis and Dynamics and he was considered pretty much 
World Class by his colleagues and associates. A number of well received 
technical papers presented by him, nationally and internationally, tended to 
verify their high esteem.
</p><p>
Personally, Crey was easy going, unassuming and one of Rog's favorite people. 
Married and completely faithful to a lovely gal, Millie, who he met in college 
and married just after graduation. Considering the level of competition she 
must have faced at that time, she had to have been one Hell of a woman. The 
subsequent years proved that beyond a doubt. With all the trappings of a 
stable, happy marriage, they now have boy and girl teenagers and eight year old
girl twins. In all their travels together Rog had never seen Crey look seriously

<!-- page 25 -->

or make a pass at another woman. God knows, his looks which if anything 
improved with maturity, provided more than ample opportunity. 
</p><p>
Jan had met Millie at some Company functions, they had hit it off and had 
become good friends, shopping, lunching together on occasion and sharing their 
respective treasuries of child rearing experience. This despite the fact that 
Newells lived about ten miles away. 
</p><p>
After a perfunctory greeting and a quizzically raised eyebrow from Crey, they 
mwienînîî Orl the way up in the elevator. Almost reluctant to explore the
myriad of frightening possibilities in prospect. Better to wait on some official 
definition and confirmation before going off half cocked! 
</p><p>
Following a quick stop at Rog's office to drop of their coats, observing that
Dan's office comprising the other half of the suite was empty, they headed down 
the hall towards the secure conference room. There they could expect to find 
the gathering crisis team. On such occasions that well equipped, secure location,
always served as the command center for these activities.
</p><p>
Now punching in the four digit code of the cipher lock, following the electronic 
beep and a click, the door swung inward revealing a well lit room capable of 
accommodating about twenty people. Its furnishings included a large 
conference table, a bank of telephones, a large TV with separate speakers, a side 
table, and cabinet housing a coffee maker and the various accoutrements
necessary for heavy use of that stimulant so much a part of these activities.
</p><p>
Bill and Phil looked up from an animated discussion at one side ofthe table and 
Dan was on a phone engaged in excited conversation. It soon became obvious
that he was talking to, Joe Callandria, his Deputy Program Manager. As it 
turned out he hadn't called Joe earlier but apparently had thought better of 
trying to handle the Program Office end of this crisis by himself. Joe had been 
with the "Retriever" program since its inception, serving in his present role 
under Ray Abbate, the original Program Manager. When Ray left the company
for a Vice Presidency position in another corporate technology giant it was 
assumed by all of their associates that Joe would be his natural replacement. 
Unfortunately, in another example of how unfair life can be, the powers that be
saw it differently. Dan Wilkes coming off a completed, lesser program, received
the appointment to the surprise and chagrin of everyone involved. 
</p>

<!-- page 26 -->
<p>
Joe was excellent technically and extremely quick witted in dealing with 
associate contractors and the Air Force customer. Diplomacy however, was not 
his long suite, and in his disappointment at the choice Rog recalled the many 
heated confrontations, normal in any such complex undertaking, in which they 
had both taken part. Joe's quick, acid wit no doubt rubbed someone of 
influence, a bit beyond they're tolerance for the give and take of such 
interaction. 
</p><p>
Now, it was with considerable relief, that from the growing drift in the phone 
conversation it became obvious that Dan had thought better of trying to play the 
"Big Hitter" in a game where he only held amateur status. Joe would be joining 
them shortly. 
</p><p>
Finishing the call, Dan moved to the head of the conference table saying, "l just 
asked Joe to come in and join us. We have one Hell ofa problem and l'm going 
to need all the assistance I can get." Somehow implying, of course, that 
anything less than a major operational "Glitch" could easily be handled by a 
competent administrator (Himself). 
</p><p>
"Rog, he continued, Colonel VonBargen called me at home around 10:30. He 
told me to drop everything and get my ass in here to a secure phone and get 
back to him ASAP. I managed to make it in and call back a little after 11:00 
just before I called you. He was particularly insistent that we have you and 
your Guys on board immediately. He insists that you call him back with a 
preliminary' action plan, as soon as we’re done with this briefing. Now let me fill 
you in on our problem, as best as I understand it from the Colonels' call, it's a 
Bitch and the operations guys in the field are really jumpin' up and down. They 
say that everything was going like clockwork up to the point of separation of 
"Retriever" from "Mother". As best they can tell, at this time, the pyro failed 
to lire in the umbilical disconnect. Then, at vehicle separation, the RV only 
moved away a few inches and was brought up short by the still intact umbilical
cord. Fortunately the subsequent Reentry Vehicle de-orbit sequence is 
controlled by the programmer in the RV, activated by umbilical separation. So 
the last word from the Colonel has the whole shebang tracking along in its 
normal orbit except that it now features our "Retriever" vehicle dangling out 
the front end, constrained by a leash, as it were, Since it's our vehicle, 
everybody wants us to tell them what the Hell to do about it and damned fast!"

Something unusual was afoot at Taruantam this night. ln recent years activity 
at the U.S.S.R. National Space Defense Command Center, located there in 
Kazakhstan, some 1250 miles South east of Moscow, had become almost routine 
eYell inonotonous. In the past 24 hours however, frantic activity had been in 
growing evidence, culminating in the high level meeting currently in progress 
in the secure command level conference room.
</p><p>
Since the security disaster in 1968 when the Americans had surprised them with
their new extended capabilit y and longer endurance serveillance satellite 
system, except for the frustration of knowing that they were constantly observed 
from above, there had been no new identifiable surprises.
</p><p>
That earlier event resulted in disclosure of a number of highly secretive 
activities which they had been successfully hiding and resulted in the 
termination of a number of promising careers and perhaps even worse, if
one was inclined to lend credence to some of the rumors following the
ensuing upheaval.
</p><p>
In the general's command conference room, Col. Vassily Gorgarich had just 
completed his briefing to Major General Sergi Stefanovich Davorkin, National
Space Defense commander and his immediate superior. "Colonel, this is a most 
disturbing development! So there can be no mistake, let me summarize briefly, 
my impression of what I think you have just told me". 
</p><p>
"For over twenty years now, we have been tracking and observen, e.-- e... „u
Spy satellites, those damned Americans have placed in orbit above our sovereign 
nation. Except for the craven deception the warmongers perpetrated on those
blundering fools who proceeded me, the lmperialist's operational pattern has
been relatively unchanged and predictable since then." 
</p><p>
"Now, as of yesterday morning, you tell me nur tracking radar images of the 
newest American orbiting vehicle, shows a significant change in configuration 
and behavior as it continues to orbit above us. This concerns me greatly! Could 

<!-- page 28 -->

we be seeing a lethal operational version of that Space Laser weapon  the 
Particle Beam device, our intelligence sources have reported under development 
in their damn laboratories? Perhaps all of their self-righteous pressure to 
outlaw the Orbital Bombardment concept, some years ago, was a deception and 
we are now looking at their operational version of such a destructive system. 
Perhaps preparing to rain a number of independently targeted nuclear armed 
reentry vehicles on unsuspecting cities in Mother Russia." 
</p><p>
"Our World struggle for victory over Capitalism has taken many twists and 
turns over the years. We have been able to keep them engaged, agitated and 
spending large sums in support of their lackeys around the World without 
direct confrontation. Now, could they have finally lost patience and decided to 
end it with a devastating surprise attack on us?" 
</p><p>
"Their new president is a former military man and seemingly more aggressive 
than his predecessor. Perhaps some of our more recent international 
provocations have pushed him to a point of taking the action he appears prone 
to, if we are to believe the Psychological profiles drawn up on him by our  
specialists in that area."
</p><p>
 "lf my first assessment and concern are correct, as a loyal officer of the great 
army of the Soviet, believe me, whatever surprise our enemies are planning for 
us at this time, will not succeed! I am issuing you a direct command to bring 
our retaliatory forces to a Yellow Alert status. Iwill immediately contact our 
leaders and brief them on this situation. Report immediately to me on any 
further changes in our tracking data and alert all forces to be prepared for 
further escalation in our alert status at any time! If those Imperialist fools want 
a war they will not find the Soviet Military sleeping as they were at Pearl 
Harbor!"

<p>
Rog had initiated some start up "Brainstorming" with Bill Ullinger, Phil Ehling, 
and Crey Newell intended to generate a preliminary action plan for the Colonel.
They quickly realized however, that to produce anuthing meaningful they 
wouid need more specific technical detail than the somewhat emotional input 
received by way of Dan Wilkes. 
</p><p>
Paul Donohue, resident manager of Omegas' field support group, on site at the 
Blue Cube, would surely be in his office at a time like this and would be party to 
the latest information available from the satellite. Donohue, a retired Lt. 
Colßllel, was a former Air Force  pilot. Because of his flying background 
and familiarity with Air Force customs and procedures, Paul was extremely 
effective in his essentially, liaison role at the satellite tracking facility. He was 
also a friendly, intelligent guy that Rog liked and had always interacted with 
amicably. 
</p><p>
They were just preparing to place a conference call to the secure phone in Paul's 
office, when Dick Flowers arrived. Alert, but still obviously a "Happy 
Hibernian" residual from his evening celebrating St. Paddy driving out the 
snakes. "Christ! Now I know l should have gone into medicine, at least l could 
have scheduled abortions at a civilized hour! Rog, it must be a bitch of a 
problem for you to cut short your annual, alcoholi'c homago lost. Pat. 
Incidentally I like your tie." 
</p><p>
"Yeah! A bitch, Dick, sit down and prepare for a long one. I'll let the Guys fill 
you in on the available details while I put through a call to Paul Donohue, We
had just started when you arrived." 
</p><p>
The call to Donohue went through quickly, Bill Tronolone, his second in 
command, answered and immediately switched it to the conference mode. The 
background noise in the room said pandemonium. Paul was on the line almost 
immediately and after a perfunctory exchange of Graveyar Humor, quickly 
Filled in the details that were not forthcoming from the earlier exchange between 
Dan and the Colonel. 
</p>

<!-- page 30 -->
<p>It seems the planned sequence for separating the number one "Retriever" 
vehicle from "Mother" had been proceeding exactly as programmed. The 
attitude control system had pointed the combination precisely, with a minimum 
of "Hunting," to within the half degree accuracy tolerance. At the pre-selected 
de-orbit initiation point, the timing sequence for vehicle separation had begun-
l`he main programmer in "Mother" had activated the independent power 
supply and event beacon in "Retriever". Then, in quick sequence, fired the 
pyrotechnic charge to separate the umbilical connection to the reentry vehicle 
initiated the `primary vehicle separation. This entailed the Simultaneous 
firing of four explosive bolts comprising the physical attachmennt between ih@ 
two units. Spring cartridges, then gently and precisely pushed Retrlever 
clear of "Mother". 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it was at this point that everything went to Hell! The umbilical 
separation event aborted and tragically, unaffected by that prior failure in the 
sequence, the vehicle separation performed flawlessly. The mechanical 
attachments were pyrotechnically severed and the spring cartridges gently 
kicked "Retriever" away. Sadly however, for only about sixteen inches. There 
it was restrained from further movement by the free length ofthe umbilical line 
still iirmly attached to "Mother" as a result of the malfunction in its 
pyrotechnic disconnect. Since that time, the total system had continued in orbit 
in an altered configuration, open at the forward end with its' "Retriever" 
vehicle dangling, as it were, outside the nose of the main body. 
</p><p>
To add to the quandary, a further complication now surfaced to enhance the 
concern. "House keeping" thermal sensors on the reentry vehicle were now 
reporting, by way of their normal data transmission, that temperatures in the 
vicinity of "Retrievers" solid retro-rocket had been increasing from an initial 
moderate cycling between 25 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, by roughly 80 degrees, 
each orbital revolution. The temperature in that area had now reached 375 
degrees and was climbing steadily with each succeeding rotation. 
</p><p>
Quiet, up to this point, along with the rest of the crew, as the conference call 
progressed Dick Flowers was suddenly agitated. "Sonofabitch! lfwe don't do 
something quick that damned retro-rocket is going to go  like a bomb! 
What's more, it will almost certainly set off the main fuel supply and blast 
"Mother" into junk!" 
</p><p>
"Oh Shit! Dick, quickly, how much leeway do we have before that happy 
occasion?"
</p>

<!-- page 31 -->
<p>"Off hand, Rog, l don't have an auto-ignition temperature on the specific fuel 
mix Thermotech loaded into that retro. I'll find out damn fast, though.  
Fortunately, I've dealt with Max Severin down there for years and he's a friend 
of mine. More important, I have his home number in my book. I'll be right back!" 
</p><p>
Suddenly now time became critical and the technicalities more than academic.
Since the earliest days of these orbital survillance programs there had always
been a lurking concern that some anamalous situation might inadvertently
de-orbit one of the vehicles, such that it reentered the atmosphere over Russian
territory, to be mistaken for an attacking ICBM. Years of improving performance
and excellent reliability had greatly diminished this concern. Now however,
statistics as they have a way of doing, was about to bite them in the Ass!
</p><p>
Dick was obviously in luck, at least with regard to catching Max Severin. In less 
than 10 minutes he came through the conference room door, if anything, more 
agitated than before. "Jesus! Rog, this is even worse than I thought. The auto-
ignition temperature on the fuel mix in that retrorocket is 980 degrees 
Fahrenheit with an error band of about plus or minus 20 degrees. By my quick 
numbers that says we have about seven, maybe eight more orbits to get that 
sucker out of the sun and drop its' temperature or we're in big trouble. Max 
assures me that under auto-ignition, that retro-rocket will go  like a bomb. 
Surely powerful enough to set off "Mothers" main fuel supply and blow her into 
a number of sizeable chunks. To the Russians, their reentry could look 
suspiciously, like a string of MIRVed (Multiple Independently Targeted Reentry 
Vehicles) ICBM'S coming to visit." 
</p><p>
With this sobering disclosure, long term planning to safely recover the 
"Retriever" vehicle and its precious payload became secondary to heading off 
World War III. Sophisticated orbital manipulation devolved to quick action 
based on one simple fact. Continued exposure, in orbit, to the ìmpingement of 
solar energy, unfiltered by the Earth's atmosphere was heating up the exposed 
retro-rocket at a continuos rate. They had to get the damned thing out of the Sun!   
</p><p>
Within minutes, Rog was on the line directly with Col. VonBargen, ignOrÍng the 
usual protocol of having Dan initiate the contact. The Colonel had, after all,

<!-- page 32 -->

insisted that Rog get back to him as quickly as possible with an action plan and 
this was surely n0 time for formalities. 
</p><p>
A quick summary of the situation got the Colonels attention. There was no 
rebuttal when Rog pointed out that, since they had no way of knowing the 
physical position or attitude of "Retriever" relative to "Mother". getting 
“Retriever” into her shadow would require a series of trial and error orbital 
attitude changes. Success or failure would be determined by monitoring 
temperature in the critical area on each succeeding orbit, with roughiy 90 
minutes between cach check. 
</p><p>
For the first corrective trial maneuver Rog requested a 90 degree rotation of 
"Mother" about its roll (longitudinal line of flight) axis. lf "Retriever" was still 
snugly in contact, or better still partly entrapped in the front end of "Mother", 
this simplest of maneuvers could get it into her shadow with little fuss. In the 
event that no positive results were forthcoming, the orbiting system would be 
im mediately commanded to rotate itself 90 degrees about its yaw (Earth 
pointing) axis on its next pass, placing "Deliverer" at the far end of the orbiting 
system facing away from the Sun. 
</p><p>
The Colonel confirmed these instructions immediately with an order to Ground 
Control. He then shut down the contact for roughly 90 minutes until the vehicle 
would complete its next orbit and present them with another temperature
reading. ln closing he did mention that he was off to update Gen. Maxtead, his 
boss at Space Command, who would no doubt inform the Joint Chiefs and
ultimately the President. That disclosure clearly defined the seriousness of the
situation, eliciting a circle of sickly expressions around the Omega conference 
table and in Dan, profuse perspiration and a nervous tic. 
</p>

<!-- page 33 -->
<mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap9' /><h3>Chap. 9</h3><br/>
<p> 
The wait, under other conditions, might have been a nail biter for the whole  
group. Assuming however they could get the Retro rocket temperature under 
control it still only bought time relative to the primary disaster in waiting.  
How long they could keep it under control was fraught with uncertainty. The  
prospects were so sobering that almost immediately the group commenced brain 
storming in a frantic search for a solution to make it all go away. Visions of 
large chunks of "Eagle Eye" reentering the atmosphere into Russian airspace 
and ultimate impact in Red territory, of debris surviving reentry heating, 
precluded the simple pleasures of nail biting.
</p><p>
Shortly thereafter much to Rog's relief, Joe Callandria, Dan’s deputy, arrived, 
After a guarded, sickly smile in Rog’s direction, he dutifully joined Dan at the 
other end ofthe room for a supposed Program Office level briefing on the 
problem. Rog would get Joe aside privately later for a more factual discussion
and to get him involved in the serious technical problem solving process. 
</p><p>
Rog had never quite forgiven the Omega corporate managerial process for what
he perceived as their cavalier treatment of his friend Joe. When Ray Abbate 
had resigned from the company, to take advantage of the great career 
opportunity he had been offered, everyone had assumed Joe to be his natural 
replacement. He was competent, experienced on the program and well liked by 
his colleagues. 0f course one of the major attributes contributing to that 
popularity was his quick wit and the acid commentary he often employed in 
dealing with the uninitiated, asking stupid questions. This, regardless of 
whether they represented management above or customer without. 
Undoubtedly it was this special skill employed at the wrong time, on the wrong 
individual, which led to his "Passover" and brought them Dan! 
</p><p>
Mutual professional respect and a shared outside interest in Jazz music 
cemented their friendship years ago. Ray Abbate, an extremely astute Program 
Manager, recognized this affinity between his assistant and his Chief Engineer 
and encouraged their working closely together. Over the years, this rewarded 
him with a number of quick no nonsense Solutions to a variety of complex

<!-- page 35 RESCAN -->
The enormous expense of putting the "Eagle Eye" system in orbit and. 
maintaining it there all culminated in the success or failure 0f recovering the 
data and material thus gathered. Out of consideration for that fact, the design

deference to their shared terror and after answering a few pointed qucstiuns 
from Joe the brainstorming resumed wlth his added presence. 
</p><p>
Now, the approximate 90 minutes required for a single Earth orbit ofthe which, 
was up and they should be hearing from the group at the Blue (Íube regarding 
the behavior of the Retro rocket temperatur@ D3" had rejoined  
even worse than before,­strangely reserved fOr him and Withdrawn giving the 
appearance that his fright had overcome his ego. He seemed ready to allow Joe, 
Rog and the technical team to work the problem without his managerial 
posturing. 
</p><p>
Fifteen minutes after "Eagle Eye" would have passed over its primary tracking 
station, Paul Donohue was 0n the secure line from the field. The news, not just 
disappointing, was to some degree, terrifying. The retrorocket temperature had 
actually increased 12 degrees more than on prior orbits and was now at a 
frightening 547 degrees Fahrenheit. The first trial maneuver had done more 
harm than good, so while the system was still in signal range instructions for the 
second trial attitude change was transmitted and the "big sucker" was now 
pointed "ass end" into the Sun as Paul put it. Hopefully, with the "Retriever" 
vehicle dangling out the other end in its long shadow, added Rog to himself, in a 
silent prayer.

<p>"They got nie home by 2:00 without miss or hitbap. damn it! I thought with 
your sudden departure, here is as my big chance to get involved in a little 
scandal. Not that Jake Horton didn't give it his usual try, but Lydia, ever alert, 
dragged him off before we could get anything going. God! Rog. can't 
imagine how your sudden departure stirred up the gossip mill at the party. 
People aren't completely stupid and by this time. they've all heard rumors to the 
effect that you're involved in some kind of Spook activity. Most of our friends 
and neighbors are businessmen or in sales and for them its' not common 
practice to disappear from a party in the middle ofthe night after getting a 
mysterious phone call. I'm sure they all have visions of you involved in some 
kind of James Bond action. You're not "shooting it out" with any bad guys, are 
you Rog?" 
</p><p>
"Oh, for God sakes. Jan. most of those business guys see more action at a 
promotional sales meeting than we ever get around here. Seriously, though. I 
thought I better let you know that my schedule is going to be a bit hairy for a 
while. I should be able to get home this afternoon or early evening for some 
sleep. I better. or I'm going to fall flat on my ass, I'm really bushed.
Unfortunately, after that l'll probably have to skip town for a while. but l'll let 
you know about that when things are more defined". 
</p><p>
"Rog! What about `Your AIAA paper presentation in Boston next week? After
all the work and preparation you put into it, don’t tell me this fiasco is going to 
louse that up?" 
</p><p>
"Unfortunately, yes, I can’t see any likelihood of getting this Glitch settled and 
making the Boston thing with my brains still unscrambled.  already­ decided 
to have Kells call the symposium director today and beg off for me. 0f course.

our calling, along with normal illnesses, it can’t be the first time they have had

Kells, this ls a bad one, worst by far than l’ve ever had to deal wnh. It looks 
like we have things under control for the moment, but its’ only a temporary fix, 
with some more real excitement due in a few days. Please make reservations for
five of us on the morning flight to Frisco for the day after tomorrow with 
indefinite return dates. We will also need reservations at Carlyles for several 
days, with options to extend the stay. You might coordinate this with Olive in 
Dan’s office as he and Joe will also be with us. We'll all be back herel first tliiiig tomorrow and you can expect everybody to drop by to arrange for thc usual 
cash advances. Incidentally, as far as the rest ofthe organization is concerned, 
Play it as cool as possible with the inevitable questions to come. There is no way of masking the increased tension and activity from them entirely, but we’re 
trying to keep the lid on as much as possible. Oh! and one more thing, Call Dr. 
Robert Powers up at M.I.T. , You have his number, in the tile.  the 
Chairman of that AIAA Symposium l was supposed to attend next week 
Extend my regrets and tell him that an urgent business matter will prevent me 
from attending his event and making my presentation.”

“Oh! Roger, that’s got to be a killer disa appointment after all the time you
put in on it, not to mention the typing I did on the document." 
</p><p>
“Yeh!  a real kick the head but as you can tell, I really have no choice. 
However, at least your typing effort wasn’t wasted, as the  already been
printed in the hand out document and will be on record as part of the

<p>The trip home, out the.Express Way, was the worst Rog could ever remember. 
They had gotten away finally about 2:30 easily in time to beat the home bound 
work crowd, and traffic on the road was relatively light. He was however 
experiencing a level of exhaustion like nothing before, and caught himself` 
dozing twice. He hadn't slept for over 32 hours and it had taken an unusually 
harsh toll. He had known sleep deprivation in other periods in his life, but he 
was younger then. Also, except for a few war associated traumas, those 
occasions were usually associated with fun and pleasurable excitement. The 
stark terror of the past evenings events and his position of responsibility relative 
to their safe resolution added another dimension, and his physical and mental 
exhaustion were like nothing he had ever experienced. 
</p><p>
Before they left Rog, with his staffs concurrence, had decided that the problem 
should be worked by a minimum size engineering team. Only those with the 
special skills and knowledge required for support in the final planning and as 
backup, when they were out at the Air Force Command Center, would be 
brought aboard the next day. Further, they would be isolated in the conference 
room for the duration of the crisis. Of course, all the other specially cleared 
people in the regular closed working area knew that a Rcentry Vehicle recovery 
had been scheduled and had already sensed their localized hyperactivity. 

W ithout additional knowledge of the actual events, however, they would 
naturally assume some anomaly in the recovery process which, while rare, did 

occur, and were generally more inconvenient than catastrophic, a far cry from 
their present quandary. 
</p><p>
After Dan had led Jack Steele away still explaining how his subtle hands off 
management style developed people who performed well under pressure, Rog 
laid out a preliminary action plan for the next few days. Initial tasks were 
assigned to those present, and with their inputs additional individuals selected to 
comprise the iînal team. Their notification would wait for the next day when it 
was agreed they would all return at the normal 8:00 AM starting time, rested 
and ready for the next crucial step. Assuming of course that the system 
continued in its present benign, quiescent orbital state!

channel." 
</p><p>
As he stumbled off towards the bedroom and shower, softly behind him, Jan 
said, "I love you, Rog, and kidding aside I know what you're doing must be 
terribly important. Get some rest, then give it Hell tomorrow! Sweetheart."

"Retriever" separatìng from "Mother" during its terminal descent and a semi-
conventional recovery of the payload capsule vvvith its invaluable cargo of 
recently gathered intelligence data.  
</p><p>
This happy prospect came t0 light two days earlier, in Rogs' emergency team 
planning activities at Omega. Bill Ullinger, their Lead Systems Engineer, 
uncovered it when reviewing the sequence of events that would now occur 
within the reentry vehicle, attached as it was to "Mother", during terminal 
descent and entry into the atmosphere of the whole "Shebang". 
</p><p>
Failure of the umbilical cord to disconnect from the "Retriever" vehicle had
fortuitously prevented actuation of the onboard de-orbit programmer in the 
reentry vehicle. This in turn precluded initiation, by that unit, of a number of events, including Retro-rocket ignition, which would have been catastrophic in its hung up state. However, while the De-orbit Programmer was primarily responsible for initiating all reentry vehicle functions during de-orbit and terminal descent, as was common practice in all space systems design, a redundant backup had been provided to insure against any single failure 
scrubbing the entire operation. 
</p><p>
In the present situation Bill found that an onboard back up device of this type might just provide a counter to "Murphy's Law", which they had not dared to hope for. Its primary function was to insure a "last ditch" separation of the reentering vehicle from its De-orbit Module, housing the spent retro rocket and associated spin/de-spin subsystem, in the event of a failure in the primary activation system. In this situation it should serve to release the reentry capsule from the plunging mother craft and actuate its programmer to initiate the remaining conventional functions of final descent. This safety back up employed 
a relatively simple G-Switch device which sensed the build up of deceleration 
forces associated with the beginning of reentry and took action at a preset level. 
This, it would do with or without the reentry vehicle still attached to "Mother", 
but perhaps at some altitude somewhat different than that originally 
programmed. It was already in place, required no further action from the 
ground, and barring further unforeseen glitches provided reason for legitimate 
optimism, and allowed them to proceed with hopeful planning for "Air Snatch" 
recovery of the capsule. 
</p><p>
The Omega team had arrived the previous evening landing at San Francisco 
Airport just around six. After baggage retrieval, car rental and the drive up the coast they checked into Carlyles Motor Inn, their regular "home away from

<!-- page 53 RESCAN -->

<!-- page 54 -->
<p>The next morning as he and the Omega team entered the designated conference 
room in the “Blue Cube”, Rog saw Col. VonBargen near the front ofthe room 
in animated conversation with Ev Morrison, Eagle Eye Program Manager from 
Langan corporation, developers of the primary “Eagle Eye” orbiting 
reconnaissance satellite system. Bill Purdy, their chief engineer and Rogs' 
counterpart, was also with them and at the moment heatedly making some 
point. 
</p><p>
Dan, titular leader of the Gmega group, as always, responding to his natural 
gravitation towards the source of power, immediately headed towards the 
eolonel's entourage and was soon shaking hands all around. Looking a bit put 
out by the interruption, the colonel quickly caught Rog's eye and motioned him 
to join them. 
</p><p>
After a very perfunetory round of greetings, reflecting the groups years of close 
interaction on the Program, the colonel got to the point. "Rog, I know we all 
need this like a "Hole in the head" but Ev and Bill have just informed us of a 
possible new anomaly that could screw up all the careful planning and 
preparation for safe de-orbit and "deep sixing" the bird. Bill, please fill him in, 
while l perform my distasteful duty of passing this news up through the chain of
command. It's a damn good thing we don't carry swords anymore, ifI had one, 
I'd be tempted to fall on it." 
</p><p>
Moving to a nearby desk top, Purdy unfolded an 81/2 X ll sheet with a rough
hand sketch, obviously drawn while previously explaining the situation. "Rog, 
you know how in the past the good Colonel has occasionally asked both of us, on 
short notice to incorporate Air Force experiments, usually unrelated to the 
mission, in our respective vehicles. Well, about six months ago we were 
requested to incorporate with a minimum of fuss, a sensing package to measure 
and count micro- meteorite impacts on the vehicle surface during its long 
duration in orbit. The collected data was transmitted periodically to ground 
stations during the more routine contacts. Basically it was a simple, minimum 
disturbance installation and we accomplished it easily with one minor 
perturbation. In fact, it has successfully flown along on the last two operations.
Unfortunately in retrospect, to install the package in the optimum location, we
had to move the primary Hydrazine fuel line, feeding the de-orbit retro rocket, 
close to the vehicle outer shell and supported it with an added bracket attached 
to an adjacent structural ring. We've never had any problems with the Bi-
Propellant fuel feed system in the past and under normal operating conditions, 
this minor modification would have been "No Sweat". Frankly, when this crisis

attested to by his rise to lead staff Thermodynamicist on the covert programs at 
the Langan Corporation. Married to Niko, a beautiful little Japanese/American 
girl whom he first met when they were children in the Utah'camp, he now had 
two boys in high school. Through years of personal contact as associate 
contractors on the “Eagle Eye” program, Rog and Sam had become good 
friends and had even been to each others homes when meetings brought them 
together on one or the.others home turf. Rog resolved to get Sam off by himself 
at the first opportunity, to get his version of what went down. Knowing Sam’s 
wild sense of humor, he’d probably claim it was his revenge for Hiroshima! 
</p><p>
Dan had been standing aside but attentively listening in 0n Bill Purdy’s 
explanation of their latest unexpected crisis. Now, that look of terror was back 
on his face and Rog figured he'd be a lot less visible in what ever transpired in 
the next round of activity. Joe, had also come over to join the group in time to
hear the bad news. Now he shook his head sadly as if to say, "here we go 
again".

Sergi Davorkìn was alone tonight. The last few weeks had been harrowing and
he had experienced the overpovwering desire to be by himself for a while. 
Clonsequently, after the days last strategy meeting, he had returned dlrectly to 
his quarters. By pre-direction, Georg, his aid had prepared a Simple dinner for
one and laid a fire in the den, before retiring. The general, now in a robe, sat   
comfortably before the fire working on his third vodka, chilled the way he liked
them. 

As Commander of the Soviet Space defense forces he was still playing the 
stereotypical "Russian Bear", grumbling, growling and intimidating everyone 
in his command since the Yankee satellite crisis had materialized. This 
domineeringg attitude somewhat reflected his personality, but not entirely. A 
well hiddenz hardly suspected, humorous streak surfaced on rare occasions, 
requiring him to bite his lip, when unexpectedly in the midst of a diatribe the 
silliness of his outward "Generals" demeanor struck him.

Irina knew it well and never let him forget this humanìzìng facet of his 
otherwise austere public persona, even if only in their private moments 
together. At times like this, he missed her terribly. Throughout his military 
career. whenever his assignments had permitted, she and the children had always,   
joined him to live together as a family and provide him as normal a 
home life as is possible in the military. 

Then, seemingly, almost overnight, the children reached adulthood and left to 
pursue their own private lives and careers. Nela, a success at Moscow 
University, where she was close to a full professorship in the school of 
languages, Vanya, Naval Academy trained, much to his fathers consternation, 
now, third officer aboard one of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the 
Soviet fleet. 

With child raising responsibilities no longer pressing and his ascendance in the
military hierarchy allowing him less free time, demanding heavy travel and
frequent base changes, Elena made a good ease for her returning to academia

<!-- page 58 -->
where he first met her. Although it left lonely moments like this one, Yin 
actuality, they were together as much, overall and frequently, under more 
pleasant conditions. She was now a full professor in History at the Smolensk 
Institute, a smaller university with a somewhat relaxed pace. On the frequent 
intervals of down time between academic sessions 0r her summer hiatus, they 
would meet at their Dacha outside Smolensk, acquired some years ago, 0r when 

he was unable to take leave she would join him at his headquarters ofthe 
moment. 

Generally, the arrangement worked well Irina had a line mind, loved to teach 
and missed it desperately when they first married and before the children came. 
Now, after those more prosaic human accomplishments, she had been overjoyed 
to resume that beloved part of her life with little detriment to the happy, if 
somewhat unconventional life they had fashioned together. For his part, it freed 
him up to a further degree to be the "Complete Soldier General" approaching 
the legend he had carefully constructed as part of his Command image. Still, as 
now, he missed her companionship and most significantly the separate 

viewpoint and wisdom she always imparted in her role of sounding board in 
many of his major decisions. 

They had first met at Kiev University shortly following "Mother Russia's" 
glorious defeat of the Fascist assault on the homeland. He as a decorated "Hero 

Of the Soviet Union", and Irina as a fledgling instructress in History at the 
School. 

As a young tighter pilot at the beginning of Hitler’s "Barbarossa" assault on the 
U.S.S.R., Sergi had not come by his decorations easily. Flying the little 
Polìkarpov  open cockpit lighter he had all the confidence and bravado 
typical of fighter pilots. He loved the squat, large engined little craft and 

reveled in its agile maneuverability, despite its somewhat limited top speed and 
sluggish climb. 

Two days after the Nazi hordes broke across the border, his fighter group had 
been rushed up to a forward air field. From there he first took to the air in an 
attempt to iight off dive bomber assaults, operating just ahead of the attacking 
German panzer columns. Their effects on the beleaguered Russian defenders 

was devastating, and threatened to turn the defense into a route. 

In his first combat he had scrambled with two wing mates, in response to a 
desperate call for help from the front. They took off and remaining at tree top

<!-- page 59 rescan-->

<!-- page 60 -->
was a sad one, they had treated him with great kindness and admiration under 
the worst of conditions and he was aware of the long odds against suŕvival they 
faced in the future, against the onrushing panzers.  
</p><p>
Three days after finding his way back to the new dirt strip his unit was now 
employing, he was back in the air again in another little I-16. Now, 
dramatically aware ofthe performance disparity in any direct confrontation 
with the Messerschmitts, he resorted to stealth, guile and unsportsmanlike 
conduct whenever engaging the Luftwaffe for a while with gratifying results. 
</p><p>
Only days after his return, emerging from protective cloud cover, he was able to 
nail another Stuka, this time just as it rolled into its diving attack. With 
satisfaction, he followed it down, firing, and as he pulled away watched it  
continue its dive uneorrected, until it erupted in flame against a hill side. Then 
slightly older and much wiser than in his,previ0us encouunter he dove to tree top 
level and raced away to escape the prowling "109's" above. 
</p><p>
In addition to the swarming Stukas, the Germans were also wreaking havoc on 
airiîelds and other installations with raids by their twin engined Heinkel and 
Dornier medium bombers. Almost two weeks after rejoining the squadron, He 
was returning from another Stuka encounter, where he had damaged one 
sufficiently for it to jettison its bomb and limp for home. Approaching the base 
at tree top level, taking advantage of the terrain background to hide him from 
the higher flying 109'5, he spotted above him a formation ofa dozen Heinkel 
111's at about 6000 feet, bomb bays already open approaching his field. Above 
them was the usual Messerschmitt two plane elements, flying top cover. 
</p><p>
Without further thought he immediately stood the little [-16 on its tail and 
climbed to the attack. His arrival from below surprised the German formation
intent on the approaching drop point. He was able to pump and extended burst
into the closest "111" and watched it blossom into flame. Conscious of the 109's 
above he rolled, dove and pulled up to make one more pass before diving for the 
deck to evade the Messerschmitts. This time, however, the bomber crews were 
well aware of his presence and as he opened fire, the gunner in the belly turret 
of the targeted "111", returned a burst, a few rounds of which found his engine. 
It immediately emitted smoke and began to pound erratically. 
</p><p>
Despite the satisfaction of seeing the second Heinkel roll off to the right and
descend in a tightening spiral trailing smoke, survival now became dominant.
As he rolled away and plunged towalds the deck, he recalled recent stories of

<!-- page 61 -->
some "109" pilots gunning for helpless victims during parachute descent. The 
engine smoke was thickening so he would have to get out before it might 
detonate leaking fuel. He was however, resolved to free fall as long as possible 
before opening the chute. He did not relish the roll of a dangling target. 

His separation from the crippled plane went well, again, n0 dûllbt, eased b." the 
open cockpit arrangement. He spread eagled to stabilized his fall while 
watching the on rushing ground to gage his optimum chute opening for 
minimum dangle time under the canopy. Of course, the whole process 
contained a heavy element of guess work with many variables. AS it was, he 

didn't miss by much, just enough to change his life'and in the ultimate sense, 
perhaps save it. 

At what he hoped was the last, safe, possible instant he pulled the parachute 
release. Then in quick order, the chute snapped open and jerked him into an 
upright position, he sensed deceleration, then a plunge through upper tree
branches and feet first impact on solid material accompanied by breaking
bones, a violent swiveling motion, a blow to the head and oblivion! 

He slowly surfaced from the depths of unconsciousness, three days later. He 
hurt all over, but with growing awareness eventually was able to localize the 
sources of his pain. His head was swathed in a bandage with a large, sensitive

lump behind his right ear. He was encased in a massive cast immobilizing his 
left leg, including the hip and the whole area throbbed like hell. When his 
return to consciousness was noted, Micha, a friend and flying mate 

accompanied by a doctor, came t0 his bedside and related the events 0f his three 
days out 0f touch. 

It seems his chute deployment, while perhaps adequate to

Personnel at the base had observed the whole episode while racing to bunkers 
and revetments to escape the descending German bombs. DeSPite Serious

the "All Clear", people raced to the tree with ladders to retrieve his unconscious

form dangling from the hung parachute. From there he was rushed to a nearby 
field hospital, where a thoroughly intimidated team of overworked doctors did a 
commendable job of repairing his damage under the threatening scrutiny of 
several of his squadron mates and the field commander's adjutant. 
</p><p>
Now, the attending doctor was assuring him that his injuries, while serious, 
should not result in significant permanent disability. The recovery process 
would take months, but with proper physical therapy he should achieve full 
physical capability, at the worst, perhaps with a slight limp. 
</p><p>
He quickly found himself regarded as a Hero and while in his early 
convalescence, stretcher bound, was taken to Moscow for an award ceremony at 
the Kremlin hosted by Stalin himself. There he received two medals 
simultaneously. One for his initial victory over the Stuka in the early phase of 
the German invasion. Russian victories of any kind were rare at that time, and 
his was duly noted and publicized. The second was, a "Hero of the Soviet 
Union" award for his single handed attack on the Heinkel 111's over his 
airfield. In full view of his squadron mates and a representative of the Moscow 
press expeditiously on the scene at the time, it had garnered him even greater 
national notoriety though it also led to his present disability. 
</p><p>
It took almost nine months, most of them at a convalescent hospital at Kamensk 
in the foothills of the Urals, before he was able to return to duty and flight 
status. Much had transpired during his enforced period of inactivity. 
</p><p>
Seemingly unstoppable, at the time of his fateful episode, the German panzer 
columns had pounded towards Moscow, with little significant deterrence from 
the disorganized and overpowered Russian defenders. Then almost as if 
scripted by Tolstoy, reminiscent of "War and Peace", the Russian winter 
arrived early and with considerable severity. This in concert with Hitlers' over 
confidence and associated inadequate preparation, brought, perhaps the worlds 
most overpowering military juggernaut, to a slithering, frost bitten halt within 
sight of Moseow's roof tops. 
</p><p>
Continuing severe Winter conditions and the inability of the Nazi logistics 
structure to supply their hapless troops on the Moscow front, set the stage. 
Thus, when the Russian high command decided to risk thinning their defenses 
in Siberia against an anticipated Japanese attack, moving crack Arctic divisions 
to the Moscow front and going on the offensive, the "Superman"/
"Untermensch" relationship underwent a dramatic reversal

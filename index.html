<a name='chap1' /><h3>Prologue</h3>
<br/>

<p>By 1982 the "Cold War" between two former World War II allies, had 
dominated world affairs for some 37 years. It involved millions of people on 
each side and millions more around the World, trying to guess which way to 
jump. The main protagonists, at the individual human level, were in many 
ways markedly similar yet en mass ideologically incompatible. The conflict and 
its various worldwide ramifications had tainted virtually all aspects of life in 
both America and the U.S.S.R. over that period. indirectly it further impacted, 
to varying degrees, just about all other people on the planet.
</p><p>
More ominous however, the advanced weaponry developed by both sides had 
escalated potential combat from the massive tank battles, air raids, and sea 
engagements projected by WW lI experience to a Nuclear Armageddon. 
M.A.D., a benign technical abbreviation for the appalling reality of Mutually 
Assured Destruction. Now relative to its impact on humanity, a brief ICBM 
</p><p>
exchange might well rival the earlier meteoric collision credited with rendering 
the Dinosaurs and many other of Earth’s life forms extinct! 
</p><p>
In concert with the development of weaponry, Orbital Surveillance systems had 
however, also progressed to amazing levels of capability. In effect, after some 
initial alarms, before both sides had achieved some level of equivalency, the 
resulting intelligence actually served to mitigate dangerous tension on both 
sides. Particularly those based on uncertainties regarding what the other guy 
had and what he was planning to do with it. Still the natural legacy of paranoia 
and distrust, engendered by the long ideological conflict, rendered the vagaries 
of day to day operations of such systems fraught with danger. Even the 
potential, enhanced by fear, for triggering a mindless nuclear exchange.
</p><p>
In the stark, cold vacuum of space the orbiting "Eagle Eye" system had been 
steadfastly tracking along its North/South polar orbital flight path for the past 
33 days. No sound accompanied its swift progress, despite the continual 
functioning of varied mechanical and electrical systems within. Its' silence, 
unrelated to the fanciful absence of a validating human ear, but simply for lack 
the atmospheric medium to transmit sound.</p>

<p>Employed in conjunction with the manned U-2 overflight and loitering 
capability the resulting reconnaissance network possessed capabilities beyond 
anything previously imagined. With the “Corona” ability to observe and 
photograph any point of interest on Earth every four days,  recovered 
material could be examined for anything suspicious or threatening and if of 
significant concern, a U-2 mission put up to take a closer more detailed look. 
</p><p>
One of the earliest, most significant pay backs of the operation was an easing of 
tension at the highest level of U. S. defense circles, resulting from graphic 
photographic evidence that the Russians were significantly behind U.S. missile 
development and possessed far fewer operational I.C.B.M.’S on the pad than 
some of the more pessimistic assessments had projected. 
</p><p>
While still an extremely dangerous stand off with little trust on either side, the 
passage of time and passing of a few of the old revolutionary "Bolsheviks" had 
further seemed to moderate the level of paranoia and hysteria that 
characterized earlier Russian leadership, fostering at least a more rational 
antagonism. In concert however with this change for the better every where 
else in the world, conditions grew worse. The ultimate demise of colonialism, 
revolutionary emergence of new political factions, industrialization and 
modernization of a number of here to fore "backward" societies, with still 
others reverting to tribal behavior, all precipitated the rise of new coniiicts. In 
many of these, the opposing factions often supported by the U.S. or U.S.S.R., in 
proxy wars, still attempting to mold the world in their disparate images. The 
result in the Near East, Far East, South America, Africa and even nearby Cuba, 
the emergence of a larger, more complex network of threats to America. 
Collectively they made the simple one on one antagonism of the early cold war 
seem almost attractive by comparison.
</p><p>
Fortuitously the continued growth in capabilities of U. S. surveillance systems, through continuous improvement of their original elements and operational procedures, plus the sequential addition of new sophisticated sensing devices, provided the necessary enhanced capability to meet the demand for increased  
world wide surveillance. With regularly updated inputs, they could pretty well 
quantify everyone’s assets, friend or foe's and when or where they might be 
massed or moved. Unfortunately, no sensor has yet been devised to determine
"Intent". A fact which continued to keep the game interesting and necessary.
</p><p>
Now, for this particular mission, the payload canister in the lirst of two 
"Retriever" reentry vehicles on board had filled to capacity with superb
<!-- page 5 -->
qualify, high-resolution photography and other sophisticated intelligence data. 
Leaving, Only, the final most dramatic and crucial  0f the Operation That 
of returning the collected data to Earth for examination and interpretation 
Though Proven and refined over several hundred similar operations, the 
associated Sequence of de-orbìt, reentry and recovery of the Payload Capsule
(familiarly referred to as "The Bucket") still constituted the ultimate "Home Stretch"
rush of excitement.
</p><p>
The technology facilitating that specific rush, evolved from one of the
earliest technical challenges faced by the fledgling Space technologists in the new 
industry. Natures master plan for Protecting Earth from catastrophic collisions was
orbiting space debris, employs the high Velocity of such bodies as they 
plunge into our upper atmosphere. The enormous frictional heat thus generated 
is Sufficient to vaporize all but the largest bodies which fortunately, are 
extremely rare. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, ICBM re-entry bodies and Orbital return vehicles all replicate 
the behavior of such bodies when they plow into the atmosphere on their return
to earth. Science obviously had to thrawt Mother Nature, if these vehicles were to
survive the initial phase of reentry and get on with their ultimate purpose.
To pull this off, techniques to precisely control reentry and ablative heat shield 
materials were developed. These materials have the unique quality of flashing dirctly
from a solid to a gas (Ablation) when exposed to high heating rates and in the process
absorb large amounts of that heat at their surface while acting as an insulator for anything
below the surface. Thus, perhaps to the consternation of the Creator, his creatures have
managed to subvert his perfectly workable system, which has thus far, protected
their home planet from becoming a pummeled ruin, to achieve their own questionable ends. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
So now, after standing by almost passively throughout the various early stages 
of the operation, the "Retriever" Return Vehicle would finally earn its orbital
ride by doing its wild, fiery thing. The terminal step of bringing home to Earth,
its' bard won intelligence payload for the mystical machinations and 
prestidigitation by the "Spooks" at the N.R.O.!

God! She was beautiful. After 30 years together and the four kids, he still loved 
to look at her. Fascinated by all her moods and postures he would often watch 
her in pure enjoyment, seemingly, without her awareness of his attention. Now, 
in perhaps her most feminine mode, Jan stood before her mirror dressed to 
party, adding final artistic touches to her hair and makeup. Even with a 
sufficient smattering of green to satisfy the St. Paddy's day motif, the sleek, 
fitted skirt and spike heels presented a stately elegance characteristic of Jan 
herself, but hardly the earthy concept of a traditional Colleen. He couldn't help 
but smile at the memory of last years costume party with Jan the hit as a 
somewhat exotic lrish barmaid, and himself as an unlikely oversized 
Leprechaun.
</p><p>
With a mixture of awe and pride, he often wondered how she managed t0 pull it 
off efficiently managing their iarge exuberant brood, while maintaining her role 
of wife, lover, party butterfly, and social activist. All this with a surprising 
tolerance for his somewhat esoteric profession and its' many impositions on 
their family life.
</p><p>
They had first met in one of those chance encounters that, at the time, seem such 
a normal part of the young social scene and then turn out to be pivotal events of 
a life time. After three years in World War Il as a U.S. Army Air Corps
mechanic, somewhat frustrated because a High School Football eye injury had 
thwarted his desire to fly, he was in his junior year at Duquesne University    
School of Engineering. For him a dream come true by virtue of the U.S.
Government and the G.I. Bill. With a working widowed mother and a younger brother 
to worry about, since early High School, he had anticipated and was   
prepared to undertake the drudgery of holding a daytime job for years, while
pursuing an Engineering Degree at night school. Then close on the joyful 
realization of having returned from the Pacific War in one piece, a "Grateful 
Nation" was prepared to provide the where with all for him to attend college 
full time, in a normal four year format. His cup damn near "Runneth Over"! 
To him it was a "Paid in Full" from that grateful nation for the three years he 
had given in their service.

<p>
Now absence became more frequent and longer,  perhaps most disturbing 
the fact that he was unable even to tell Jan where he was going, or at times, 
when he would return. "If anything comes up, call Kells and she'll get the 
message to me."
</p><p>
The highly efficient "Kells", Ms Evelyn Kelly, his harried, high security 
secretary, was constantly on the brink of a well deserved nervous breakdown. 
ln addition to her more prosaic secretarial duties, she also served as the singular 
communication link between some forty other traveling "Spooks" under his 
command and their bewildered loved ones. 
</p><p>
The "Retriever" program was classified as a "Special need to know" operation, 
well beyond "Top Secret" and its related security measures were commensurate 
with that lofty level of conspiratorial paranoia. The effects of such rigorous 
requirements for secrecy, on the personnel thus engaged, were many and varied, 
some humorous and some stultifying. 
</p><p>
The rigid monthly accounting for all classified documents, invariably led to, at 
least, one hysterical secretary in tears, in the ladies room over the temporary 
misplacemcnt of a report, drawing or specification. On these occasions, the 
indomitable "Kells", drawing on her personal experience, as big sister to a large 
Irish family, enlarged her span of control to that of house mother to such 
distraught young women, who envisioned themselves on the way to Levenworth. 
On others, particularly some engineers involved in the intricacies of design and 
operations, the effect of such overbearing secrecy was to adopta permanent 
sotto voce, conspiratorial tone, that annoyingly, persisted for all occasions. 
Particularly irritating, when employed in response to irrelevant questions about 
the weather or how they liked their coffee.
</p><p>
Aptly named, "Retriever" was simply a complete ReentrylRecovery Vehicle 
system, initially employed with, "Corona" and subsequently, a number of other 
orbital reconnaissance systems, such as "Eagle Eye". lt was designed, to 
precisely and reliably return from orbit, the photographic film and associated 
data, generated by the sophisticated cameras and other sensors in these 
operational surveillance satellites. 
</p><p>
One of Americas' most outstanding successes among early attempts to employ 
space technology for military purposes. Surely far preferable to the more 
widely recognized potential for delivery of nuclear warheads. The System had 
performed reliably and with increasing capability since its' early development

<!-- page 9 -->
under the original "Corona" program. The collective output of these systems, 
in effect, drove the Russians "Bonkers" and kept an unblinking eye on other hot 
spots such as Cuba, China, Iran, Iraq, plus lesser sites of periodic minor wars 
and revolutions that might ultimately precipitate American involvement. 
</p><p>
Without being able to share the satisfaction and excitement of direct _ 
Involvement in such anendeavor, Jan seemed to sense the passion of his 
participation and from it, draw a measure of fortitude, sufficient to tolerate
the associated inconveniences.
</p><p>
Tonight however, she was ready for an evening out with old friends in a party atmosphere.
Sartorially armed and dangerous, ready to do battle with her lady friends for the honors as
Top Babe in the neighborhood. Looking at her now, she sure could count on his vote! 
</p><p>
First, Jan's customary final instructions to Elle and Lainie, their two remaining 
High Schoolers at home. "No unannounced visitors, finish your homework, limited television,
and to bed at a reasonable hour." The girl's cound have  recited them from rote and
hardly looked up from their homework to acknowledge. Then, as an afterthought, writing
the Blaines' telephone number on the kitchen note pad, which, while readily accessible
in the phone book, served to emphasize their close proximity, if anything came up 
requiring parental attention.
</p><p>
Now, in the ear for the three blocks drive to the Blaines, Jan chatted on about 
her growing desire to return to the work force. With both younger girls now in 
High School and the older two boys in college, there was no longer a pressing 
need for someone at home. Consequently, Jan was starting to heed the call of a 
of a more dynamic daily environment. Rog had some very mixed feelings about such
a change in their family routine. True, the added income would cut down 
 on the accruing debt associated with putting four kids through college but there 
is no such thing as "Free Lunch" and he knew it. This however was an evening 
for fun and relaxation, not controversy, so he strategically withheld serious 
comment, knowing full well that it would come up again, and soon. 
</p><p>
A number of early arrivals, required their parking down the block from the 
Blaines. The night however, was crisp and clear and the short walk provided a 
refreshing interval, as a prelude to the crowded boisterous party atmosphere in 
prospect.

<p>
Throughout the developmental process, from the initial "Corona" concept to
the present, multi-sensored intelligence gathering satellites, associated triumphs 
and tragedies abounded, some even, with their humorous side. 
</p><p>
The unfortunate reentry overshoot of an early developmental model and its 
subsequent landing near a Russian, mining camp in the Arctic, was not one of 
the funny ones. It led to their early acquisition of a technically priceless 
American ilight unit, which, no doubt, greatly accelerated their lagging 
developments in this area. The event, iictionally depicted, to some degree, in 
Ian Flemings "Ice Station Zebra", presented a stupefying example of art 
mimicking life beyond all rational explanation. 
</p><p>
Initially, after a brief period of productive covert observation, the Russians 
tumbled to the realization, that their key facilities and activities were being 
photographed from space on a regular basis. Coincident with that 
understanding, insulting messages such as "F--k you, Yank!" began to appear 
on hanger roofs and other surfaces at their various military installations. They 
also'initiated a number of creative attempts at camouflage and deception to 
mask their points and activities of interest. 
</p><p>
Later, when they developed the capability for orbital photo reconnaissance, our 
side enthusiastically joined them in the game of roof top harassment. In the ¿t 
midst of the grim give and take of cold warfare, it almost provided a humorous “di 
camaraderie between the initiated and an outlet for acid wit on both side.
</p><p>
A later American "Gotcha" added renewed spice to the game, with introduction
of an advanced model, which featured considerably longer orbital life and greater capacity.
This expanded capability required multiple "Retriever"
reentry/recovery vehicles, returned sequentially, as each reached its full payload capacity.
Examination of the photography in the second recovered -ï vehicle of the first revised orbital operation, nearly knocked the sox off the N.R.O. photo interpreter spooks. Scores of new items of interest were

The neighborhood early birds were already there and remaining Iaggards 
arriving rapidly, mostly couples, with the occasional single survivor of family 
tragedy, natural or legal. An interesting mix, ethnic, religious or political 
persuasion, but from the celtic viewpoint, on St. Patrick’s day, all present, either 
Irish, or "Thim that wish they wuz!" 
</p><p>
Annie and Josh Blaine, aggressively the former, welcomed them when they 
arrived, directing them to the bar in the game room and the upstairs bedroom 
for dropping off their coats. A simple but unnecessary opening formality, 3S 
they could easily find both blindfolded, after years on the local party circuit, of 
which the Blaines were an integral part. 
</p><p>
Returning to the bar area, from his dropping off the coats chore, Rog found Jan 
in conversation with Liz and Harry Duffey and the Barthalemews, Millie and 
Bob. Both neighbors and friends of long standing with much in common, 
including kids away at college. The trials and tribulations of those displaced 
offspring was the subject of the current conversation, as it invariably was 
whenever they got together. After a few drinks, the conversation would turn to 
more diverse, less mundane subjects. 
</p><p>
Both Harry and Bob were blessed with excellent voices and a bit of amateur 
theatrical work in their college days. Later, after a few drinks, in keeping with 
Irish partying tradition, they would end up competently harmonizing on 
"Danny Boy“, "Galloway Bay" and other favorites, while the rest of the drunks, 
including Rog, would, inadvertently, do their best to louse up the beauty of the 
thing, by joining in. 
</p><p>
He spotted Abe Klein and Sylvie just coming down the steps and eased over to 
say hello. He had wanted to talk to Abe privately anyway and this was as good a 
time as any. Abe, like himself, had worked at Omega Technologies for a 
number of years. In fact in their younger days they had worked several projects 
together and had become friends. For several years now Abe had headed up the 
Thermodynamics Analysis Group and Rog considered Dick Flowers, assigned to 
him on Project "Retriever" from that group, one of his key players. Rumors

and having grown up playing stick ball and other local favorites with his 
contemporaries ofthe streets, Rubin Belkoff was perhaps even better liked than 
his father and easily took his place in the community. The crowning indicator 
of his place in local Gallic hearts, came when he was invited to be an honorary 
member on the Hibernian Society and march with them in the local St. Patrick’s 
day parade. This he did with great glee and as they pranced by the family 
pharmacy, Sylvie, her .Grand mother, her mother and two siblings, stood at the 
curb and waved small green St. Patrick’s day flags, enjoying the event 
immensely. 
</p><p>
Abe and Silvie's three children, agewise, were distributed such that they were 
involved with the Mannion brood throughout their growing processes in a 
broad spectrum of school and recreational activities. Hank and Julie, both 
families eldest, enjoyed a quasi- romantic friendship through out high school. 
They attended some dances and other parties together and then were formal 
dates at their Junior Prom. In their senior year however, preoccupied with 
coming college and career planning, any earlier ardor appeared to 
metamorphosis into a solid friendship which has persisted in spite oftheir 
divergent career interests. Now, Julie was a senior Physics major at Columbia, 
already accepted for graduate work at M.I.T. with long term plans for a 
doctorate and a research career. She was also romantically involved with a 
Colombia graduate student in chemistry and seemed happily destined to join 
him ultimately in solving the worlds energy shortage. 
</p><p>
Hank, had developed an increasing passion, throughout his lligh School years,
for Scuba diving. He and YRog had taken an introductory course at the local 
YMCA which culminated in certification and authorization to rent diving 
equipment and use it. Initially, they enjoyed diving together at several nearby 
lakes and quarries but where Rog was content to keep it simple and 
recreational, Hank joined an active diving group. He soon had acquired his own
gear and was into serious ocean diving at various wrecks and other points of 
diving interest, while still in High School. As a natural consequence he was now 
finishing work on his Bachelors Degree in Marine Biology at University of 
Florida and had been accepted for Graduate work in Oceanography' at Woods 
Hole. Romantically, he had yet to develop any serious attachments, but 
appeared to be enjoying all those beautiful girls in bathing suits he encountered 
in the normal pursuit of his academics.

<p>Specific de-orbît instructions for "Retriever" had been uploaded to "mother" in 
lts last orbital pass over station "Bourbon" in the Australian outback. Now the 
system was approaching the sequence initiation point and things were starting 
to happen. 
</p><p>
The first action in the process of separating the reentry vehicle from "Mother", 
required disconnecting the umbilical cord providing electrical contact between 
"Retriever" and the rest ofthe "Eagle Eye" system during orbital operations. 
Not unlike unplugging the family vacuum cord from a wall socket at home, the 
plug however, considerably larger, more complex and the force to unplug it, 
provided by a small controlled explosive charge. 
</p><p>
Now with precise timing to set off that charge, the onboard programmer 
directed a small spike of electric current to the igniter squib in the umbilical 
disconnect unit. The resulting small blast, would literally blow apart the two 
mated segments constituting the connector. It was the simplest of functions in a 
sequence including some very complex ones, flawlessly repeated several 
hundred times in past operations, only this time, as if to demonstrate that there 
is no permanent reprieve from “Murphy’s Law”, nothing happened! No blast! 
No movement! No disconnect! The damned thing failed to lire! Leaving 
Retriever inexorably tied to “Mother” by an Electrical cable pull tested to 
withstand well over 1000 pounds. 
</p><p>
Over many years of operations, this particular anomaly had never occurred and 
because the event was so uncomplicated and unanticipated, there was no sensing 
provided in the system to detect it. Thus, unaware that “Murphy” had struck at 
this most unlikely point, the sequence continued uninterrupted. 
</p><p>
As programmed, two seconds later, simultaneous, small electrical pulses were 
transmitted to the three explosive attachment bolts retaining the "Retriever" 
vehicle in its mounting cradle. All fired, as planned, releasing the vehicle and 
allowing the spring ejection system to propel it away from its mounting surface, 
for subsequent spin up at a safe distance from "Mother".
